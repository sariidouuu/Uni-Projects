# Flight Delay Analytics with Apache Spark (RDD)

This section includes the analysis of flight data to identify delays and statistical patterns using the **Apache Spark** framework.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools
* **Apache Spark:** Implementation of the RDD API for large-scale data processing.
* **Python (PySpark):** The programming language used for algorithm implementation.
* **Jupyter Notebooks:** Used for the presentation and execution of code across different tasks.
* **Pandas & Matplotlib:** Used for data cleaning and visualization of the results.

## 📊 Project Description
The project is divided into individual tasks (Notebooks) covering:
1. **Data Processing:** Loading and cleaning the `flights_2000.csv` file.
2. **Delay Analysis:** Calculating average delays per airline and airport.
3. **Top Routes:** Identifying the most frequent flight routes and analyzing traffic.
4. **Statistical Data:** Exporting results in CSV format (e.g., `top_10_routes.csv`).

## 📁 File Structure
* `Task 1 - 5.ipynb`: Notebooks containing the implementation of each query.
* `Report.pdf`: Comprehensive technical report of the project.
* `flights_2000.csv`: The dataset sample used for analysis.
