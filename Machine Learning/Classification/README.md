# Supervised Learning: Classification

This folder contains the implementation of various Classification algorithms as part of the Machine Learning curriculum.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools
* **Python:** The core programming language used for model development.
* **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb):** Used for data exploration, model training, and performance evaluation.
* **Scikit-learn:** Implementation of popular classifiers and evaluation metrics.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data preprocessing and numerical analysis.

## 📊 Project Overview
The project focuses on building and comparing predictive models for classification tasks:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Algorithm Implementation:** Training models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVMs.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Analyzing performance using Confusion Matrices, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters to improve predictive power.

## 📁 File Structure
* `Classification_Analysis.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the implementation and results.
* `dataset.csv`: The data used for training and testing the models.
* `Report.pdf`: Detailed documentation and analysis of the findings (in Greek).
