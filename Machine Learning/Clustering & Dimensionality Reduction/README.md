# Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction

This folder contains the implementation of Machine Learning projects focused on dimensionality reduction and data clustering techniques.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools
* **Python:** The primary programming language used for implementation.
* **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb):** Used for experimental analysis, step-by-step execution, and visualization.
* **Scikit-learn:** Utilized for implementing PCA and t-SNE algorithms.
* **Deep Learning Frameworks:** Implementation of Stacked Autoencoders (SAE) for feature extraction.

## 📊 Project Overview
The project explores the following techniques:
1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Linear dimensionality reduction to preserve maximum variance.
2. **t-SNE:** Non-linear dimensionality reduction specifically for 2D/3D data visualization.
3. **Stacked Autoencoders (SAE):** Utilizing deep neural networks for efficient data representation.
4. **Clustering Analysis:** Grouping the extracted features and evaluating the performance of the models.
